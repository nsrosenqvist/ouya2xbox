OUYA to XBOX
============

This is an experimental project to automatically emulate OUYA controllers as Xbox360 controllers when they are connected so that the controllers can be used as gamepads for a Linux based gaming machine.

Xbox360 controllers are much more widely supported and by having this automatically run in the background you can easily use your controllers for most Linux supported games.

The shell script works in it's current form but it's mostly considered a test. The plan is to create a daemon and GUI with this functionality.
